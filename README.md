## About The Project
# Aegis: AI-Powered Fraud Detection in E-Commerce

Aegis is an AI-driven backend system built to detect and prevent fraudulent behavior in online marketplaces. It is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing e-commerce platforms, flagging potentially malicious users, transactions, and product listings in real-time using smart anomaly detection techniques and behavior-based scoring models.
This project simulates real-world fraud use-cases in online marketplaces and provides a robust API-based backend to mitigate them before they cause harm — making marketplaces safer and more trustworthy.

How it all started:
With the rapid rise of e-commerce platforms and the increasing convenience of online shopping, the digital marketplace has become a double-edged sword. While it has empowered both sellers and buyers, it has also opened doors for fraudulent practices. The term “scam” has unfortunately become a frequent part of conversations around online shopping.
* fake products and phony listings - Fraudsters often list counterfeit items by copying images and descriptions of genuine products. These fake listings may come with tempting prices to lure customers. Once purchased, the product received is either substandard, completely different, or never delivered at all.
* review scams - To manipulate trust, sellers may use bots or hire fake reviewers to flood their product pages with positive ratings and reviews. This misleads genuine customers into believing the product is high-quality, resulting in poor post-purchase experiences.
* return scams - Some buyers exploit return policies by sending back a different or damaged product, or even empty boxes, while claiming a refund. This not only results in huge financial losses for sellers but also shakes the credibility of platforms offering “easy returns”.

These types of frauds—often invisible to the naked eye—create a toxic environment of mistrust, reducing both user retention and seller satisfaction. Recognizing this gap, Project Aegis was envisioned as a smart, AI-driven solution to identify, prevent, and reduce fraudulent activities in e-commerce ecosystems.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!--
## Getting Started
To run the project, you will have to go through the following steps
### Prerequisites
First and foremost, for ease diving, install VS Code

After doing so, open two terminals. One for frontend and the other for backend.

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
